<strong><i>Although the end seems near
(your neighbourhood and race
gone to the dogs), my dear,
dear reader—do not cower
in fear; stand up and face
the dogs! In you the power
remains to save the West.
Put down your childless Spengler
who spawned two books at best.
Better to heed the deeds
of a forsaken prisoner
like Hess, or charge on steeds
like John Sobieski, steady
in soul; to follow Lee’s
Rebs into battle, ready
for a certain death,
than to live on with fleas
upon your blood and breath.</i></strong>
