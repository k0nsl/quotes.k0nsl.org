For those interested in the Treblinka transit camp should probably want to read Richard Glazar's story regarding his stint at Treblinka. Glazar inadvertently let the <strong><em>"cat out of the bag"</em></strong> when he said in his <a href="http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn502870" target="_blank">interview</a>:


<blockquote>
La: "The people from your transport?"
Gl: "Those weren't the belongings from that transport, the one we came with. But on one place I saw piled up suitcases with the letter Bs, Bt ..., transports which preceded ours and went further to the East."
</blockquote>


Yes... <em><strong>"...went further to the East."</strong></em>
Glazar was held back at Treblinka to do labor duty at the camp while the rest of the people <strong><em>"...went further to the East."</em></strong>.
