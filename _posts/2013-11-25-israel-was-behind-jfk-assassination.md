An American political commentator (Dr. Kevin Barrett) says Israel was behind the assassination of former US President John F. Kennedy because he opposed Israel’s plans of becoming a nuclear power in the Middle East.

“Anyone with any common sense knows that Israel getting nuclear weapons was a complete disaster for the world,” he said.

<mark>“The Israelis are fanatical extremists who feel that they are being persecuted everywhere they go and they have to be extremely harsh, unyielding and aggressive as well as deceptive and violent with the world. So they have a terrible track record of extreme deception, lies and extreme violence. They are ruthless, they are psychopathic and they are the most likely…to use nuclear weapons,”</mark> Barrett added.

“President Kennedy like President Eisenhower and all rational Americans obviously wouldn’t want Israel to have nuclear weapons. Kennedy tried to shut down the Israeli nuclear program. [Former Israeli Prime Minister David] David Ben-Gurion resigned in protest and less than <mark>six months later Kennedy was dead and Israel was on its way to becoming a nuclear power</mark>,” he stated.
