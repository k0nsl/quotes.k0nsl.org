An upset Benjamin Gessel (✡) says we cannot rewrite history. But as any normal person knows, history is constantly revised and rewritten — it's the way it works and always will work, I hope. Alas, as the history is his beloved Holoshlock he says it cannot and <b><i>must</i></b> not be rewritten :)

<strong>NOTE:</strong> I  wrote the reply/comment on YouTube in haste (as always) so there could be error in grammar and formatting. It's not as if the comment section at YouTube is of much importance, anyway. Not to me. A quick reply with the essentials will suffice.
