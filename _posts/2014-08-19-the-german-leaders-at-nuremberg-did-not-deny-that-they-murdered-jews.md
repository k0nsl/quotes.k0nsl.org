Verbatim: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii_iS6bY7nY#t=278" target="_blank">« and let me remind you that the German army, the German leaders, at Nuremberg, did not deny the allegations that they murdered jews in these camps »</a>. But wait, hold your horses Mr. Braden: the Germans vehemently denied these things, unless they were tortured or otherwise persuaded to tell fairy tales — as in (for example) the <a href="http://forum.codoh.com/viewtopic.php?t=2656" target="_blank">case of Rudolf Höss</a>. <a href="http://forum.codoh.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=8165" target="_blank">Here's over seven pages of such denial</a> - from many German leaders and prominent figures at the time.

Alas, the CNN Crossfire host — Thomas Braden — is caught in a blatant lie. He also starts off the program by babbling absolute rubbish, which Mr. Zündel easily refutes.
