Irma still had the heart and mind of a little girl. This was further accented by the fact that observers would see her scribbling something down on her notepad whenever malicious accusations were made against her by perjuring witnesses. While the observers ASSUMED that Miss Gresewas writing down information to prepare for her rebuttal or defense, in reality all she was writing were little words of encouragement to herself, such as "Kopf hoch!," (Head high!) and so on.
