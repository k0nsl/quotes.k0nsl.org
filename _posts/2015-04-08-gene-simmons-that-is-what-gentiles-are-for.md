This is the same message taught by most rabbis. For example, the former "Chief Rabbinate of Israel", a certain Ovadia Yosef, said of us the following <sup>[1]</sup>:
<blockquote><strong>“Goyim were born only to serve us. Without that, they have no place in the world – only to serve the People of Israel,”</strong> he said in his weekly Saturday night sermon on the laws regarding the actions non-Jews are permitted to perform on Shabbat.

According to Yosef, the lives of non-Jews in Israel are safeguarded by divinity, to prevent losses to Jews.

<strong>“In Israel, death has no dominion over them… With gentiles, it will be like any person – they need to die, but [God] will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one’s donkey would die, they’d lose their money. This is his servant… That’s why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew,”</strong> Yosef said.

<strong>“Why are gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat. That is why gentiles were created,”</strong> he added.</blockquote>

That's your greatest ally <img class='wpml_ico' alt='' src='http://quotes.k0nsl.org/wp-content/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/lol.gif' />
