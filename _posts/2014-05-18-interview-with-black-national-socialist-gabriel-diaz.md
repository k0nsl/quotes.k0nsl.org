The interviewer, Lou Young (?), appears incredibly dumb. Mr Diaz already told him in the beginning that he's a "national socialist", then at 2:49 or somesuch, the interviewer goes "it sounds like you're a NAZI!". What a pitchfork.
And he keeps asking him about the alleged 'holocaust' over & over. Anyway, one can certainly understand why Gabriel Diaz would like Adolf Hitler -- this despite incessant lies that Adolf Hitler hated black people and viewed them as sub-human (Untermensch). Props to this black guy for having the guts to openly say what many would keep to themselves.
