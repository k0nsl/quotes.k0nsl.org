"There are Hard Drives and Solid State Drives, wouldn't a liquid drive be NOT a Hard Drive? It would be a Liquid State Drive. There would then be Hard Drives, SSDs, and 'LSD' - tekjunkie. <em><strong>Would you guys get your 'LSD' a online or 'discreetly' behind a local tech store</strong></em>." -- blackice11z
