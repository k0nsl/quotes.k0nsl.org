Description from the author:

<blockquote>In light of all the fun times concerning the Ebola outbreak, I got some inspiration to destroy John Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads" with some /pol/-style ebola-themed lyrics.</blockquote>



<strong>Lyrics:</strong>

<blockquote>Took a plane ride with Ebola
Flew to Dallas.
Caused another Shoah.

Thomas Duncan, she loved him 'till he died.
There's no cure for love when you're bleedin' from the eyes.

Take my hand Ebola-Chan.
Spread your love through the land.
Hemorrhagic, ain't it magick?
Take my hand Ebola-Chan.

CDC clowns build a circus,
While they're holding the patent on our Goddess.
Mr. Frieden, a merchant through and through.
No surprise the CDC is run by the Jews.

Take my hand Ebola-Chan.
Spread your love through the land.
Hemorrhagic, ain't it magick?
Take my hand Ebola-Chan.

Now spread your wings girl, the whole earth is calling.
The happening of happenings is truly on the way!
Bathe all the degenerates in their own blood and purge them all away!
Purge away!</blockquote>
