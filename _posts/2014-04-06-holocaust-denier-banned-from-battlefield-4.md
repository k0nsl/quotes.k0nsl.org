<strong>E-mailed EA the following:</strong>

<blockquote>Hello,

I have been requested (more or less forced) to change my username (AHolocaustDenier). I am wondering; is this official EA policy to interfere in players personal convictions?

There are swarms of Communist emblems and names to that effect all over Battlelog / BF4, but a benign name such as "AHolocaustDenier" is apparently against the policy. So as for these Communist emblems / names (and whatever else); should they be removed, as well, or do you only target <em>some</em>?

I'm just curious. And somewhat perplexed.</blockquote>
