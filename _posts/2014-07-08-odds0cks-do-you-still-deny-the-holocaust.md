&lt;odds0cks&gt; haven't seen you around in forever k0nsl

&lt;odds0cks&gt; forgive me for being silly but ...

&lt;k0nsl&gt; :)

&lt;odds0cks&gt; do you still deny the holocaust?

&lt;k0nsl&gt; of course.

&lt;odds0cks&gt; or am I confusing you with someone else

&lt;odds0cks&gt; you were on cruel-intentionz back in the day? not to mention a bunch of other forums

&lt;k0nsl&gt; yeah :]

&lt;Digerati&gt; haha

&lt;Digerati&gt; blast from the past

&lt;odds0cks&gt; indeed

&lt;Digerati&gt; odds0cks: did you have a different nick back then?

&lt;Digerati&gt; i don't remember you

&lt;odds0cks&gt; I've gone by a few, I won't mention

&lt;odds0cks&gt; I know you Digerati ...

&lt;k0nsl&gt; (horror movie music)

&lt;k0nsl&gt; I beg my pard for that, Digerati.

&lt;Digerati&gt; :(

&lt;k0nsl&gt; anyway, glad to hear from somebody I presumably knew back in the day :D
