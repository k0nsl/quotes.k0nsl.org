I am apparently a vicious "raycist", a "nazi" and also German -- for pointing out (to a Muslim) how old Aisha was when she got married to Mohammed; according to most sources I have seen (including on heavily censored sites such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisha" target="_blank">"Wikipedia"</a>) Aisha appears to have been between six or eight years old when Mohammed married her. I don't think she had much say in whether she wanted to marry him or not.
At any rate, these Muslims, and it includes this Egyptian guy who calls itself "t0xic" either support this blatant act of paedophilia or they don't. Simple. In t0xic's case it appears to me that he's defending such behaviour, judging by how he reacted by adding me to his ignore list, and then went on to call me a bunch of names on a totally different IRC network in order to rally up sympathy from easily fooled cuckolds...

I write in the title of this post "extremist" because I find it extremely foul to defend paedophilia, no matter if you're a muslim or a jew. Et cetera.
