<blockquote>Dayana Jadarian — who is running for Swedish parliament and calls herself ‘smart, sharp and gorgeous’ on Twitter — said she was unaware David Duke was a former Ku Klux Klan leader [<strong>NOTE from k0nsl:</strong> <em>that was about twenty years ago, or some such</em>], though it claimed on the post she agreed with his controversial views.</blockquote>
Ramsey sounds like he's afraid to even touch upon the 'jewish question'. I guess it all boils down to money and fear, because if he spoke the truth about jews — which he cryptically does on rare occasions — he looses subscribers. So he therefore must sidestep the most important question of all times: the root cause of every major problem in the world, which are created by mainly jews....

Conclusion? Ramsey is what he call other people: a "pussy".
