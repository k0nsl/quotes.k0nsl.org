<strong>A brief reply to that, all very spontaneous as usual:</strong>
<blockquote>In today’s sense the assertion “American hero” is more an oxymoron than anything else. This could be as a direct result of the mirror image adopted by Americans via your role models — the Jews — and their ‘heroic struggle’ to murder women and babies in Palestine, etc,. Ya, what a bunch of heroes you are.
I am not a defender of Michael Moore, but at least he is not participating in liberating peoples from their lives and homelands in the name of ‘freedom’, ‘justice’ and not to forget, ‘democracy’, in a cause that is of no benefit to any American, but only to one people. You know, the ones who own you and which you must not name because they would howl you down as a 'hater' and 'anti-Semite', but I do it anyway, earlier in my paragraph <img class='wpml_ico' alt='' src='http://quotes.k0nsl.org/wp-content/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/wpml_yes.gif' />

Rep. Paul Gosar is only a useful idiot to the Jews, that's about it. The same goes to anyone else who is doing what he's doing. If you are American then you should concentrate on working for your own interests and your own people — not be the cannon fodder for a very vocal minority. That's stupid.
