Today is the day when Corneliu Zelea Codreanu was shamefully murdered -- remember and honour his memory. You can read his book <strong><a href="https://pdf.k0nsl.org/F/For%20My%20Legionaries%20-%20Corneliu%20Zelea%20Codreanu.pdf" title="For My Legionaries" target="_blank">« For My Legionaries »</a></strong> <small>(<strong>Roumanian:</strong> Pentru legionari)</small>, it was first published in Sibiu, 1936, and is today more relevant than it ever was...

<blockquote>"This volume contains the story of my youth, from 19 to 34 years of age, with its feelings, faith, thoughts, deeds, and its errors." -- Corneliu Zelea Codreanu</blockquote>

If you own a better digital copy of this book, send it to <a href="mailto:i.am@k0nsl.org" title="e-mail k0nsl" target="_blank">i.am@k0nsl.org</a> and I will have it archived for posterity on my site: <a href="https://pdf.k0nsl.org" title="k0nsl's PDF Archive" target="_blank">https://pdf.k0nsl.org</a>. The one I have linked in this entry is the only one I have, IIRC -- with the exception of the actual book which resides in my bookshelf:
