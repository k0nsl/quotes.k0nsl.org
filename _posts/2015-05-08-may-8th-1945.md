Apparently, these Jewish war agitators on the other side of the Atlantic cared nothing for the lives and safety of the German Jews. They continued their agitation in the most evil manner as war came, with their constant defamation of Germany and Hitler.

Our successors know absolutely nothing about the foregoing events. The German folk are purposely kept ignorant by the politicians and media. Why?
