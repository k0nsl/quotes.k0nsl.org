<strong><a href="http://codoh.com/library/authors/1425/" title="Bradley R. Smith" target="_blank">Bradley R. Smith</a> tells us:</strong>
<blockquote>Why does the American professorial class insist that students “believe” what they are told – and told and told -- about Germans and Jews during World War II? Why does the American academic refuse to encourage students to create a free exchange of ideas about what really happened during that fracas? Why? One word reveals the story. That word is “shame.”</blockquote>
