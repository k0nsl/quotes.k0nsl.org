The exchange in the screenshot is naturally fictional. Why is this funny? Well, because  Jaroslav Urban is a sock puppet of Jon Nguyen (GreenValueHost). In a typical <a href="http://quotes.k0nsl.org/jon-nguyen-jaroslav-tyler-was-just-a-gimmick.html">"GVH announcement"</a> Jon claimed Tyler operates AcclaimedHost.com, but this company is registered to somebody named Alan Romano -- who's [hosted] with  Hudson Valley Host.

This may only be humorous to somebody with at least some insight into the hosting industry.
