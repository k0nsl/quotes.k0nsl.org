Snapped this up from YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC7oGgHH_os&amp;google_comment_id=z13gihcxguboch4ri04ccjgzjnrsdjyzkrc0k" target="_blank">source</a>). Only modestly edited by me:

<blockquote>I never thought I would write this on my country's liberation day. But I've come to believe Germany wasn't the evil in this conflict. Peiper was a great war hero and larger than life. I believe he fought in Western Europe during 'Fall Gelb', and he fought in Russia, fought in 'Battle of the Bulge'. Peiper got 'convicted' to death in the subsequent Nuremberg trials, but eventually set 'free'.
Later, he went to France. He was killed in late 1970 by bunch of French cowards. The witnesses say he knew he was going to die, and he went to his front porch and calmly waited there with a pistol in his hand...</blockquote>
