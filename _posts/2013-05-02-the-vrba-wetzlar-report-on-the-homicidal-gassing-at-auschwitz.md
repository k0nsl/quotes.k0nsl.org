"The gassing takes place as follows. The unfortunate victims are brought into the hall where they are told to undress. To complete the fiction that they are going to bathe, each person received a towel and a small piece of soap issued by two men clad in white coats. Then they are crowded into the gas chamber."
â€” The Vrba-Wetzlar Report on the homicidal gassing at Auschwitz II (Birkenau), April 1944
