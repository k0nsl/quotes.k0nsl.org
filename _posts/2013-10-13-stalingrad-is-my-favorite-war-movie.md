Vilsmaier's Stalingrad is also one of my favorite war movies. I especially like the attack on the factory and the battle against Soviet tanks in the snow. I also remember a scene in which one of the protagonists complained to some Nazi skunk (shot by German soldiers later in the film) about the treatment of Soviet prisoners of war (new window), and another in which a German penal squad was forced (by the aforementioned Nazi skunk, IIRC) to shoot a group of Soviet civilians (new window), including a boy they had previously befriended, who were claimed to be spies or saboteurs or partisans (new window). I wouldn't be surprised if those were the "minor historical errors" that k0nsl refers to.
