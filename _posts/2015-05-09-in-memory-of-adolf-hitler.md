Dear Friends,
   
Knut Hamsun, Norwegian author and recipient of the Nobel Prize (in the 1920s â€” at a time when it was still "prestigious"), wrote in May 1, 1945, a memorial to Adolf Hilter which was printed in Aftenposten, Norway's largest newspaper. Following is a translation in English, as nearly as possible, his words: 
<blockquote><span style="color:red">I am not worthy to be vociferous about Adolf Hitler. Any sentimental words I use cannot describe his life and activities.</span>

<span style="color:red">He was a warrior for mankind and a believer in the gospel of right for all. His historical destiny was that he acted and worked as a reformist of the highest rank in a time of unparalleled brutality which, in the end, felled him. And in remembrance, his closest followers, and Western Europeans, all should see Adolf Hitler in this manner.</span></blockquote>
