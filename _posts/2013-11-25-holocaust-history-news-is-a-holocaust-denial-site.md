<blockquote>Just so you are aware, <em>Holocaust History News</em> is a Holocaust denial site. It's supposed to look "official" to lure in the casual reader with their outright lies. So no. There is no truth to it.</blockquote>
&nbsp;

This <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Bernardito">Bernardito</a>, who is moderator in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians" rel="nofollow">/r/AskHistorians</a> at Reddit, fails to list even one "outright lie". The person insinuates that there are several since he speaks in plural.  The topic of discussion was my document titled <a href="http://holocaust-history.net/main/Documents/Judea1.php" target="_blank">THE JEWS DECLARE WAR ON GERMANY (IN 1933)</a> and to my knowledge there is not a single error in this particular document.

Bernardito <em>(could this be the infamous </em><a href="https://rodoh.info/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=742&amp;view=previous#p15203" target="_blank">Bernard</a><em> from <strong>'Holocaust Controversies'</strong>?) </em>bumbles on and goes on to say this:
<blockquote>Regarding the quotes: Usually, in a site like this, they're either taken out of context or purely fabricated. For example, the David A. Brown quote can apparently only be sourced from an anti-semitic book.</blockquote>
&nbsp;

This is generalization without substantiation of statement. Also, just because an alleged <a href="http://k0nsl.org/blog/detox/lets-decide-what-is-and-isnt-anti-semitism/" target="_blank">'anti-Semitic'</a> book has the quote does not make the source or the quote itself invalid. This sort of argumentation is at the most childish.
