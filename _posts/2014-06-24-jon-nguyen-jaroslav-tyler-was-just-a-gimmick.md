Jon Nguyen of GreenValueHost writes the following message in an attempt to defend his most recent deceit / lies:
<blockquote>Due to initial privacy concerns and a verbal non disclosure agreement I was unable to be honest with the situation in it's entirety. I deeply apologize for this and would like to take this opportunity to provide an explanation.
Yes, <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">we do have multiple people working under aliases</span>. Tyler is the real name of both aliases, and yes, he does run AH [AcclaimedHost]. Tyler has only recently started working a few days ago, however is actually appointed interim Operations Director to help the company get back in shape.

As he specifically requested to be unpaid and not to receive compensation, he does not benefit from this other than the fact that improving the company would trigger a domino effect that would improve our overall services, which he makes use of. AH and GVH [GreenValueHost] are separate companies, independently operated. Lance [Jessurun] remains stable and firm as our CEO, with the 'Operations Director'/COO title being assigned to the member of staff responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations and making sure the company runs smoothly. As of right now on an interim accord, that is Tyler, or 'Jaroslav'.</blockquote>
