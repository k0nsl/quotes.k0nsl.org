Mr. Friedrich Paul Berg tells us:
<blockquote>There is a possibility of a real holocaust in Gaza today, largely condoned by the ordinary man on the street, because of belief in the holocaust hoax.. That is the price the world is paying right now for the greatest hoax in history. And, the price will become much higher. It will probably include WWIII.

The obscene racist lunacy which is Judaism was in serious decline u-n-t-i-l the alleged "extermination" of the Jews in WWII gripped the shabby consciences of many people. Suddenly, Judaism got a huge burst of adrenaline and was reinvigorated as never before. Today, Jewish racism is embraced practically as a kind of compensation for the horrors inflicted on supposedly "innocent" Jews by the "evil" Nazis. End result: Jewish racism is OK and supported in every possible way by the west, whereas every other kind of racism is denounced and attacked. As Golda Meir said after the Eichmann Trial: "after this, no one can tell us anything."

So, the horrors we see on our TV's every day go back to the holocaust hoax. Netanyahu knows perfectly well that he can get away with anything by invoking the "holocaust".

If you ever want to see real peace in the Mid East, stop lying about the so-called "holocaust." It is all bunk just like Judaism itself, or Christianity, or Islam, or any other kind of religious lunacy.</blockquote>
