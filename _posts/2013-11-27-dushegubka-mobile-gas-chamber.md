Now you know who invented the 'mobile gas chamber' nonsense. As you probably know, the Germans were accused of liquidating tens of thousands of people (most of them Jews) in <a href="http://inconvenienthistory.com/archive/2012/volume_4/number_3/the_gas_vans.php" target="_blank">'mobile gas chambers'</a>. This is for the most part claimed to have been done with diesel exhaust (which contains very little carbon monoxide, and not with petrol (which is highly toxic). As story tellers they do a good job, but matching their stories with rational thought and logic always crushes their dinky winky lies.
