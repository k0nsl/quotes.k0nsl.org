<blockquote>GVH is my life. If it's the end of GVH then it's the end of me, I can't pick myself up if I lose this company, it means everything to me. I'm going to try and do everything I can to recover our data and if I fail, I will leave a handwritten note on my desk and post a copy of it here before I'm gone.
&nbsp;
Reality has never hit me this hard. It hasn't. And now that it has.. now that I have nothing in my hands right now, I can't find it in myself to continue.</blockquote>
