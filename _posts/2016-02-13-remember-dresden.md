<strong>Don't forget:</strong> even if the so-called <a href="http://holocausthandbooks.com/index.php?main_page=1" target="_blank">jewish "holocaust"</a> had any merit to it (i.e systematic extermination in make-shift chemical slaughterhouses with a lame pesticide) this act of Allied mass murder outdoes the jewish spectacle with ease. Still, we never read about it in school, or in the media. There's no Obama "crying" for the victims in Dresden.
