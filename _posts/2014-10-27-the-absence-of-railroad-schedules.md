<strong>Text:</strong>
<blockquote>The key to understand that is the almost complete absence of railroad
schedules and other details to the East of the Greater Reich, i.e. into
basically Bielorussia & the Baltic zone from the transit camps such as
Belzec, Treblinka and Sobibor, all of them placed squarely on the
frontier limit of the Greater Reich.

Note that I'm not saying simply that there are no "relevant"
indications. What I'm saying is the whole railroad documentation that
ought to be there has vanished in a strange way. You have plenty of
information inside the Reich. Absolutely nothing outside. Not
"inconvenient information" but plainly "no information at all".

But if you have any experience of talking to "survivors" you'll have
heard lots of them telling you how their grandparents were taken from
Central Germany or Bohemia or what have you into the giant ghetto /
labor camp of Maly Trostynets near Minsk or into Kaisernhof near Riga
etc.

A few of those missing train schedules have appeared on Mattogno's
Treblinka book and confirm the transfers into the Eastern territories,
but why would all the railroad data have vanished from view in such a
nearly complete way?

Well, I certainly can guess why...</blockquote>
