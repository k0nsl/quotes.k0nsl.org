I'm not sure if this could be the origin for the various 'moose'-references made with regards to my person, but here's how the moose is described:
<blockquote>[...] moose are solitary animals and do not form herds. Although generally slow-moving and sedentary, [the] moose can become aggressive and move surprisingly quickly if angered or startled.</blockquote>

I'm known to be quite sedative (boring), but never a couch potato <em>(so the 'sedentary' description fails in this regard)</em>. I like solitude.

I find particularly several references to this "moose issue" with regards to myself from one specific individual who <del datetime="2014-06-08T08:45:57+00:00">used to</del> collects [and put together] information on revisionists, passing along his dossier(s) to obscure jewish groups. He says this:
<blockquote>Pathetic, you sad fucking revisionist troll wanker, K0nsl. Go and get into some argy bargy with a moose.</blockquote>

I had to clean it up somewhat. The man is not sane. This riff-raff who authored the second quote is apparently a big follower of myself, but I'm not particularly flattered by it.
