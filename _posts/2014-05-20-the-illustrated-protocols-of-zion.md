A PhD, Dr. David Duke served in the House of Representatives-LA (1989-1993) and has lectured in over 200 universities around the world.

This is a video preview of Dr. David Duke's new book, The Illustrated Protocols of Zion is an historical and literary valuation of the original Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion.

He presents the case that Protocols of Zion could well be titled the Protocols of "Zionism" in that it predicts many of the horrific wars and conflicts right down to the issues in the Israel or "Zion" of today and associated with Zionist power and influence that goes far beyond the borders of Israel.

In this video and and his book upon which it is based, he shows that many of the most radical claims of the Protocols are today proclaimed by Zionists themselves around the world. such as domination of media, banking, and extensive power and influence in America, the EU and in many governments around the world.

He quotes leading and influential Zionists and Zionist media in showing that many of the most important underlying themes can be be documented in historical and contemporary terms.

Dr. Duke points out its true history. He argues that the Protocols is obviously not the secret meeting of earlocked "Elders of Zion" anymore than 1984 is a true account of Big Brother or Oceania.

He examines it as dystopian literature that is amazingly prescient and predictive since its publishing well over a century ago.

This video and the powerful underlying book The Illustrated Protocols of Zion are essential materials to understanding the Zionist issue from all perspectives.

A Phd in History, Dr. Duke shows how vital assertions of the Protocols can be historically and contemporaneously documented and that many of the most shocking claims of the Protocols can be found in even more extreme expression by modern Zionism.
