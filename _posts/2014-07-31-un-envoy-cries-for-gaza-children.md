Dr. David Duke exposes a video of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFd8jVrbf0A" target="_blank">UN Envoy on Gaza refugees who breaks down in tears</a> after learning of another horrific Israeli mass murder bombing of a UN operated school and civilian shelter. Suddenly the links for the video disappeared from mainstream publications. It looks like the Zionists thought it was too moving and they did not want it seen by people in Western nations!
