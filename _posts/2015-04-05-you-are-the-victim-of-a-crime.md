I first found, or learned, rather, of this clip via Jultomtemor. I have cut out everything in it, all but Lord Nelsonâ€™s speech and the one by K.L. The credits at the end of the clip has been left unmolested.

What is my reason for cutting it? Because the rest of it would make no sense without English subtitles: a language which surely is understood by a great many people, all over the world. Norwegian with Swedish subtitles (burnt-in) would make very little sense to most people. [DELETION]

At any rate, enjoy this clip. <strong>Please spread it far and wide:</strong> to your friends and to people who may find it interesting. Et cetera. You know the routine better than me <img class='wpml_ico' alt='' src='http://quotes.k0nsl.org/wp-content/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/wpml_whistle3.gif' />
