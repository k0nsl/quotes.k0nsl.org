<blockquote>What is life like in Sweden? "The politicians are participating in a chicken race of “goodness” where everybody tries to one-up each other in caring for the citizens of OTHER countries while Swedish retires, school children, handicapped and other vulnerable categories of people are thoroughly ignored." 

Check this blog out by an American living in Sweden: <a href="http://swedenreport.org/" target="_blank">http://swedenreport.org/</a> He does a great job of detailing the Swedish absurdity. Too bad he moved away for the very same reason.

Let's clarify a few things. 

1. No, there is no irony in an immigrant wanting to decrease immigration. Last year we took in 120'000 immigrants, the year before 100'000. Your countries aren't taking in as much so how the fuck can you whine about me uttering common sense and saying that we should take in maybe 5000-10'000 a year instead of 120'000 with our housing shortage? When me and my family came here in the 90's there wasn't a housing shortage like this one and Balkan people were easier to integrate too, so obviously immigration wasn't as big of a problem back then. 

2. I don't hate blacks, arabs and jews. No idea why some of the comments are like that. I am not against immigration as a phenomenon. Of course Im not saying that every country should close it's borders. I'm just asking that other countries in Europe take more responsibility with asylum seekers so that we in Sweden don't have to take as much. It's fucking killing us. Our politicians are too scared to integrate immigrants properly and it's causing problems for both the ethnic population and us who have come here over the past years. 

3. Of course influences from foreign cultures can be positive. Foreign influences have helped make Swedish culture awesome, by introducing great food and music, to only mention a few examples. But that's not what multiculturalism is. Multiculturalism is when you refuse to acknowledge that foreign cultures have negative aspects as well as positive ones. Multiculturalism is cultural relativism. It's when a country adapts entirely to the immigrants, and not the other way around. I gave an example of this later on in the video with the "greeting quarrel" where the radical muslim refused to shake hands with a woman. That's not acceptable. This is a secular country, adapt to that. 

Here in Sweden cultural relativism is the norm. Suggesting that some cultures are more civilized and evolved than others is considered to be racism. Which is retarded, obviously, since a culture isn't a person. A culture is a set of ideas in the shape of norms, values and traditions. You can't be racist towards ideas. Preferring one culture over the other only means that you have a personal taste, not that you hate people because of their skin colour. 

Obviously, I don't mind immigrants who come to Sweden and respect western values such as equality and human rights for women + homosexuals. I do however mind immigrants who refuse to shake hands with women, beat their children, force their daughters to wear veils and demand respect for their religious medieval bullshit ideas about the world. Any sound atheist would.</blockquote>
