been-there talks about <a href="http://codoh.com/search/?q=Rudolf+Hoess&sorting=relevance" target="_blank">Rudolf Höß</a> and the latter's peculiar "confession":
<blockquote>
Rudolf Höß "confessed" that an "extermination camp" was already operational at Treblinka in SPRING 1941.I.e. built and operational even before that time.
Höß "confessed" to visiting Treblinka himself in the Spring of 1941 and witnessing Jews being gassed there. He says he went thereto learn how to build a similar but better extermination centre at Auschwitz. He "confessed" that after witnessing Treblinka and improving on the system[atic?] <a href="http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1946hoess.html" target="_blank">"mass executions by gassing commenced during the summer 1941"</a> there in Auschwitz.

Höß also "confessed" that he visited Treblinka to learn how gassings were conducted there in the Spring of 1942 and witnessed Jews being gassed.
He "confessed" that the Kommandant of Treblinka told him at that time that he had mass-murdered 80,000 'Jews' via homicidal gassings in the period of the previous six months, i.e. since the Autumn of 1941.

But the official and currently accepted 'holocaust' narrative is that Treblinka II and the alleged gas chambers was not built then. Not in Spring 1941, not in Autumn 1941, and not in the Spring of 1942.

The official and currently accepted 'holocaust' narrative is that gas-chambers at Treblinka II were only built in the summer of 1942 and were first used on July 23rd 1942.

There are great many other more minor discrepancies. But this one of chronology is quite major.
He "confessed" in many separate related particulars and on numerous different occasions to it being an 'extermination camp' and operational in the gassing of 'jewish' victims <strong>fifteen months too early</strong>!
