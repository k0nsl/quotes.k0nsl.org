<blockquote>“OK, a few notes on the Jews ………. Jews are anti-social, destructive, intolerant, mean-spirited, deceitful, etc. They wish to destroy, rule and kill, rob whoever gets in their way. To facilitate them getting what they want, they have developed a perverted, unnatural, destructive, evil lifestyle.

Even though they live off of the non-Jews as parasites; they still hate them and wish to destroy them. Jews hate nature and the natural order, because it’s pure and beautiful and also because it’s bigger and stronger than they are, and they feel that they cannot fully control it*. Nature’s beauty and harmony stands in stark contrast to their squalidness and ugliness, and that makes them hate it all the more.

Jews are destroyers. They are anti-human.

The anti-human Jew hates and wants to destroy all non- Jews. He will also destroy even other Jews who are less destructive and evil than he is, if they get in his way. Apparently the wickedness of the Jew is genetically based.*

Jews are destroyers. They are anti-human.

By the act of circumcision the Jew shows his hatred towards nature and the natural order. By this bloody, cruel, senseless act, he shows his cruelty and sadism and that he will stop at nothing to obtain his end.

Surely the Jews are also behind Islamic circumcision which serves as an ideal cover and distraction from their own wickedness in this regard.

Jews are truly anti-human and anti-nature.

Jews are intensely selfish, intolerant and anti-social etc. They are full of hate, greed, malice, etc. Naturally other people – i.e. the non-Jews don’t like being bulldozed aside robed and murdered by the Jews; and will sooner or later resist. That is where the lies and deceit of the Jews come into play …”
