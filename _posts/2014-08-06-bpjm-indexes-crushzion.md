Dear Madam/Sir,

the BPjM is an administrative authority of the German government called "Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien". Our task is to protect children and adolescents in Germany from any media which might be harmful or dangerous to minors (e.g. racist / violent / pornographic content). This work is authorized by the "Youth Protection Law" (Jugendschutzgesetz - JuSchG). You can find further information about our work in the enclosed form.

A German youth welfare institution has requested the BPjM to examine the site http://crushzion.k0nsl.org    and to enter its address into the "list of youth-endangering media" because of the glorification of National Socialism.

We would like to ask you to forward us your post address, so that we can then properly notify you about the request by the youth welfare institution and give you the opportunity to reply within one week after the notification.

Best regards,
Mit freundlichen Grüßen
