This is a cursory glance at Windows 10 Technical Preview (build 9926). It's very basic and will only give you a general idea of how it will look compared to Windows 8.1.

I don't actually discuss anything in the video. It's just raw footage. A clip I put together in the spur of the moment, as always. So you know what that means ;-)

In reality, I never intended to upload this at all. However, why not?
