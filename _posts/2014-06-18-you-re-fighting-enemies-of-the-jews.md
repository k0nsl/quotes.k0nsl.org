&lt;slashsux&gt; I'm totally for war. In order to be a strong nation, you must have a strong military. You must be aggressive, I'm surprised with how much you love Hitler and Germany.. k0nsl, that you're not more about war and the military.
&lt;k0nsl&gt; i do, but today's wars are pointless -- we're killing ourselves for zionist interests, you could just as well throw yourself in front of a two tonne truck.
&lt;slashsux&gt; what wars are you referring to?
&lt;slashsux&gt; I've said it before, In our lives, we'll see the USSR again.
&lt;k0nsl&gt; any war since 1945, there's been what? 80? I dunno, perhaps more.
&lt;slashsux&gt; its already started, and nobody is going to stop them.
&lt;k0nsl&gt; but any of the wars in the ME are incredibly pointless for any American, or European.
&lt;slashsux&gt; I could understand why you say that about Iraq.
&lt;slashsux&gt; But afghanistan? You do remember we're not fighting afghanistan, we're killing terrorists, because the blew up some shit in our country.
-*status- *** k0nsl detached (from 127.0.0.1)
&lt;slashsux&gt; and fuck you k0nsl, I know your country is getting over ran by musliums, along with every country in europe.
&lt;slashsux&gt; I cant believe you're not 100% for us killing them
&lt;k0nsl&gt; i'm looking at who brought them in here.
&lt;slashsux&gt; And honestly, Iraq was, and should have been a huge tactical advantage for the USA on the war on terrorism.
&lt;slashsux&gt; We should have never abandon Al-Asad
&lt;k0nsl&gt; there's even a friggin' book about how my country became a "multicultural one" - "Hur Sverige blev en m√•ngkultur".
&lt;slashsux&gt; We should have had half a million troops stationed there for the next 100 years
&lt;k0nsl&gt; you're wasting your lives, money and resources on fighting enemies of the jews when you could concentrate on building a better America.
&lt;k0nsl&gt; but w/e
&lt;slashsux&gt; well.
&lt;slashsux&gt; I can somewhat agree with you
&lt;slashsux&gt; Because everyone thinks were weak because of bullshit presidents
&lt;k0nsl&gt; that too..
&lt;k0nsl&gt; we think they are laughable.
&lt;k0nsl&gt; but so are ours.
&lt;slashsux&gt; these fucking musliums need to be exterminated
&lt;slashsux&gt; musliums are to me, what jews are you to you k0nsl
&lt;slashsux&gt; So fucking much, I joined the marines to kill them.
&lt;slashsux&gt; Which, I didnt directly do... but I did service helicopters, and other airborne death machines, so.. yeah.. they killed people.. team effort

Correction: there's been over 140 'warlike' conflicts since the end of 1945, a good portion of which has been for judeo-supremacist interests.
