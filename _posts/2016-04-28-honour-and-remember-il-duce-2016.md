Today we remember the cowardly murder of Benito Mussolini.
We will cherish the memory of this magnificent man whether the so-called democracies like it or not.

<small><strong>‘Democracy is beautiful in theory; in practice it is a fallacy. You in America will see that some day.’</strong> — Benito Mussolini</small>
