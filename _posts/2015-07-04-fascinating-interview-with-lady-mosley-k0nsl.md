This is a fascinating interview with Diana Mosley (nee Mitford; the sister of Unity Mitford) who was married to Oswald Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists. Interestingly enough, the Mosley's were close acquaintances of both Adolf Hitler and Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.

It touches on the big "H" in the first few minutes.

Thanks to CODOH Forum participant Mulegino for the description and for sharing the MP3. I only converted it to another format and uploaded it here.
