...upon a return following a visit to Hitler by Lloyd George, his daughter greeted him, humorously with a “Heil Hitler!” <em><strong>“Yes, Heil Hitler. I too, say that because he is truly a great man. I have never met a happier people than the Germans and Hitler is one of the greatest men among the distinctly great men that I have ever encountered.”</strong></em>
