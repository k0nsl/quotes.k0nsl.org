<a href="https://vivaldi.com/#Features" title="Vivaldi: a new browser for our friends" target="_blank">Vivaldi</a>, a really decent browser with great looks and functionality:
<blockquote>Vivaldi will adapt as you browse the web. A clean and modern interface to complement the content you are browsing. It’s also highly customizable – don’t like the tabs on top? Simply put them where you want, bottom, left or right.</blockquote>
