<blockquote>On December 13, 2014, Ursula Haverbeck, aged 86, the widow of a pastor, took the heroic decision to address her fellow Germans on what she calls “The greatest problem of our time”. It is the greatest historical problem with philosophical, moral and political implications of the past 70 years.

This historical problem is that of whether the genocide of approximately six million Jews, particularly by means of homicidal gas chambers, is a historical reality or not.
