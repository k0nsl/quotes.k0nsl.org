<blockquote>The historic 2015 interview, as edited by Panorama TV for mass consumption. Watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPa_QeV9KDM" target="_blank">49-minute original</a> and compare!</blockquote>

On the CODOH Revisionist Forum <a href="https://forum.codoh.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=9536&start=15#p72615" target="_blank">Kladderadatsch writes the following</a>:
<blockquote>I originally meant to do this earlier to coincide with the main release, but I want people to be able to compare the various different versions of the Panorama interview. Apparently Bongen and Haverbeck talked for some four hours back in March: from that taping, the 49-minute "full" interview was created. I'm willing to give ARD and Panorama the benefit of the doubt that the editing on that version was largely neutral, and that the material which was cut was indeed mostly small-talk or digressions and so on, and thus justifiably omitted. However, as some have noted, that 49-minute interview is not in fact what was shown on Panorama last month: rather, a 9-minute edit was aired instead. Curiously, however, Panorama still chose to release the longer version online: one can only suppose they thought that its contents would be still more "damning" to her . . . the irony being, of course, that it turns out the full interview is a remarkably charismatic performance which, a few questionable arguments aside, makes a powerful moral case for the revisionist cause.

Maybe they figured they'd overstepped, I don't know. But in case anyone were to ask questions where they stand on the matter, they also produced a two-minute dumbed-down version, complete with mournful piano chords and stock-photo images of Bergen-Belsen to drive the point home. It's a study in media manipulation and Internet-age propaganda. No doubt this is what they were hoping would "go viral." Short, simplistic, hitting all the right clich√©s, and without all that pesky evidence from the Commandant Orders!

I originally found the short version on huffingtonpost.de (<a href="https://archive.is/GIq6x" target="_blank">https://archive.is/GIq6x</a>)--that's the sort of audience they're aiming at. And to give them their due, the video counter on the Huff Po page indicates that it's been viewed more than 170,000 times there. Just a reminder of what the imbalance of media power means to the truth sometimes.

With any luck, I'll get the 9-minute version worked up sometime this weekend, and then my trilogy will be complete. For now, here's the MSM's two-minutes-of-hate special.</blockquote>
