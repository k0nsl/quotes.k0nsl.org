<strong>Description:</strong>
<blockquote>As kosher supermarket hero Lassana Bathily becomes France's newest citizen, scattered deniers still defy Big Brother Valls and refuse to "be Charlie" in this zombie thriller by Bernamej.

For English-speaking viewers who might not get some of the references, a little background . . . 

Lassana Bathily is the Malian guest worker at the Jewish "Super Kosher" (Hyper Cacher) supermarket in Paris who helped save some customers during the hostage/shooting at the store on 9 January 2015 by hiding them in a downstairs freezer. In recognition of this act, he was granted French citizenship on 20 January 2015, in a ceremony attended by French prime minister Manuel Valls. During the ceremony, Bathily read out a speech, excerpts of which appear, as recorded, in the video. The whole thing (French only) can be viewed here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Un_ONT6mwM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Un_ONT6mwM</a>

Other characters appearing in the video include François Hollande, France's feckless socialist President, who holds the record for lowest approval ratings for a sitting President in French history; Minister of Justice Christianne Taubira, originally from French Guyana; and of course Big Brother himself, Prime Minister Manuel Valls, Spanish-born Socialist notorious for his self-righteous grandstanding and relentless pursuit of politically incorrect "thought crime" in France, most notably in the form of quenelle-sliding comedian Dieudonné. (See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenelle_%28gesture%29" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenelle_%28gesture%29</a>)

Finally, the song at the end of the video is a traditional (16th-century) French folk song called <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaWwjx22LuY" target="_blank">"Je suis Robert"</a></em></strong> (I am Robert). LICRA is France's equivalent of the ADL.
