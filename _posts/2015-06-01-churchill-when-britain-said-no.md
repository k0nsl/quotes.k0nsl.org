<blockquote>Family's fury as BBC brands Churchill 'an enemy of the people': New documentary depicts former Prime Minister as a deeply hated drunk

A BBC documentary depicting Winston Churchill as a drunken enemy of the working class has been branded as ‘graceless’ and ‘ill-informed’ by his grandson.

Churchill: When Britain Said No, broadcast on BBC2 last week, was an account of how the wartime leader lost the 1945 General Election.

It showed him as a deeply hated figure among the working class, in part because of the harsh economic policies he pursued as Chancellor in the 1920s.</blockquote>
