Below is parts of Nate Miyaki's writing <i><b>"Find Your Fight"</b></i> published in 2013 at <a href="http://www.t-nation.com/powerful-words/find-your-fight" target="_blank">T NATION</a> (Testosterone Nation):
<blockquote><u>The path to success lies in the purpose, not the person.</u> We're all capable of great things. Ordinary men that had a purpose have achieved great things. Extraordinarily gifted men with no mission have chronically underachieved. Society provides plenty of examples of both.

Rule #1: Find what you're fighting for.

Rule #2: First learn rule #1. Everything else is just details.</strong></span></blockquote>
