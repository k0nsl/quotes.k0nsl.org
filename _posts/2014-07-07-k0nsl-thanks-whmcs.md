&lt;k0nsl&gt; heh, one provider I am using had one bill for me in my account -- some 165 dollars: now that bill is gone and it isn't archived as paid or unpaid either. There's nothing there. It's just gone. Thanks WHMCS!
&lt;b0b&gt; they just knew you were gonna be all jewy and not pay it so they dropped it
&lt;b0b&gt; they were like, "nope, not worth it to go after that fucking hermit"
&lt;k0nsl&gt; haha!
