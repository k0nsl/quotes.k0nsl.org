On pacifism & pacifists.

Non-violent movements have a poor track record. The few successful cases (Gandhi, Martin Luther King...) are misleading, since they were backed up by the threat of violence by allied movements. 

The antiwar movement has indoctrinated itself with a number of pacifist delusions. For instance, the belief that peaceful protest ended the Vietnam war, instead of the armed Vietnamese and the high number of violent rebellions among US troops.
