Australian former prime minister Malcom Fraser claims that Israel deliberately bombed the [American ship] USS Liberty in June 1967.

The former prime minister made the assertion while promoting his new book Dangerous Allies during an interview with ABC Radio Melbourne broadcaster Jon Faine last Friday, during which he also said former foreign minister Bob Carr was “absolutely correct” in his view that the pro-Israel lobby wielded too much power.

“Israel years ago, during one of the wars, killed 30 or 40 Americans on a spy ship in the Western Mediterranean,” Fraser told Faine. “The Americans tried to cover it up. It wasn’t a mistake. It was deliberate.”

When asked on what he based the claim, Fraser said: “Information I have. I am not going to tell you the source.”

Asked by Faine if he agreed that <strong>“the pro-Israel and in particular Jewish community lobby in Australia wielded too much power”</strong>, Fraser responded, <strong>“They certainly do.”</strong>

When Faine suggested other religious, ethnic and communal groups, like the Italian community, also lobbied the government, Fraser said, “I don’t think the Italian community, just to take one example, try to get us to follow any particular policies in relation to Italy. And that’s the difference … The Jewish community seek to get Australia to support policies as defined by Israel.”
