A brief announcement from the <strong>"Jan27.org Committee"</strong>:
<blockquote>
Friends!
We're soon nearing the end of December and into January. Please have a look at the following site -- jan27.org -- and realize that 2015 is the 70th Anniversary year of the so-called “lie-beration” of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp by the Soviet Red Army and the Soviet Political Commissars.

Although the Red Army arrived in January 1945, the exact date is not known, nor were there very many inmates to “liberate.” The Germans had evacuated the camp on or around the 18th of January, leaving behind some 7000 hospital patients, under the care of doctors and nurses, and those unable for other reasons to undertake the day-long march to Gleiwitz. <small>[Once there, the marchers rested a couple of days before taking a train to Buchenwald or some other work-camp destination.]</small>

When the Red Army came upon the mostly empty camp (more like around Jan 20th), they simply continued on “toward Berlin” while the political operatives entered the camp and began assessing how to use it for propaganda purposes. They had “liberated” the abandoned Majdanek camp outside Lublin six months before, and now they had another opportunity to create an even bigger propaganda story.

That is all the so-called liberation of Auschwitz really is. But The Holocaust Industry, led by the United Nations, the Polish government and the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial Museum will be making a huge hulabaloo in 2015 because it is the 70th Anniversary of this non-event.

This entire website, jan27.org, is devoted to explaining to you what Auschwitz-Birkenau-Monowitz really was and what actually took place there. Look at the menu items across the top of the page, under the banner, and select one that you want to learn about. You will find the essential information you need to know, written by some of the best revisionist scholars in the world.

Watch the videos; they tell the story of Auschwitz-Birkenau and only this camp, no other. That is because Auschwitz was made the center of the “Holocaust” from the beginning, at the Nuremberg Tribunal; thus if the Auschwitz legends are not true, then none of it is true.

Kudos to those of you who have the courage and intellectual curiosity to assess and judge information based on its merits rather than simply indulge in hysterical “victor propaganda” without ever digging in deeper to see it for what it actually is, just plain propaganda and lies. You can find out much more about it all by visiting our site for more information — be sure to invite your friends as well: <a href="http://jan27.org/" title="Jan27.org Committee" target="_blank">http://jan27.org/</a>
