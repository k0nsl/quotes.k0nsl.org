A Jew told us this so it must be true. They would never lie about the situation in Palestine...right? The many thousands of murdered babies are just unfortunate victims (and potential future terrorists)...ahem, right?

Of course it's genocide, anybody with a peabrain recognises this simpleÂ fact. In the Zionist mindset a Jew can never be guilty of killing goyim - it even says so in their holy books.
