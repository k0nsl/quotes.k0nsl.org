I stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c5NSkpQThw" target="_blank">speech</a> by a so-called 'holocaust survivor' two days ago. Her name is Rachel (Rae) Gleitman and she presumably made her speech in front of an audience packed with young kids. Anyway, I got infuriated and quite simply called her a liar, and that's what she is -- it didn't take long for somebody to come along and ask me "why". I answered it effortlessly and will likely not hear from that person ever again.

I got a reply from a Patrick Dempsey who called me a idiot and asked if I thought engines could not fail. Now, this is about Auschwitz and it is not alleged engines were used there, so I simply made fun of him, because he is the true idiot:
