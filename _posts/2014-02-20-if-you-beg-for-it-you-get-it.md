<blockquote>Whilst I have no time for these exhibitionist morons, I find it disgusting that they were attacked by a man who is almost twice their size. No male with any shred of dignity should behave in this manner towards a woman, even if the woman concerned is behaving like a retard. I understand that Pussy Riot have disrupted religious services and that they clearly have no respect for the beliefs of others, but hitting people with a crop is assault and if they are on private property they should simply be removed by the people concerned. Violence is not the answer.</blockquote>



Aren't they (PR) staunch supporters of feminism, demanding to be treated just the same as any man, and that there's no differences between the sexes? I don't think that retard would've agreed with you, Mr. Southgate.
Her ideology dictates that there is no differences between a man and a woman; so in her mind it was probably like being hit by a heavy woman who was unusually strong. I am not saying it was OK to hit her, or that you should hit a woman <em>(if she even calls herself that)</em>, but I have no sympathy at all for the incident. If you beg for it, you get it.
