I'm currently testing Xshell 5, their open beta. For years I've always done most of my stuff via the console, or PuTTY. The Xshell 5 is great because it offers a 'tab based frame' for your sessions, which is terrific! It's also possible to send a command to all sessions which can be useful in many scenarios. Another thing about it which I liked is the possibility of session restorations -- and the interface itself is OK, but could be better..
Anyway, check it out for yourselves! This is actually something I'd be willing to pay for :)
