In 1946 the Allied Military Tribunal at Nuremberg declared itself to be an instrument of <strong><em>“a continuation of the war effort of the Allied nations”</em></strong> against Germany – IMT, XIX, p. 397.
To this day courts in Germany are bound by any of the tribunal’s statements, as codified in the 4+2 treaties of 1990, and cannot challenge their validity. However, this makes a mockery of Germany’s Basic Law (Grundgesetz) that has enshrined <em><strong>“freedom of opinion”</strong></em> as one of its pillars – Section 5.
And so in order to circumvent Section 5 of the Basic Law, Section 130 of the Criminal Law (Strafgesetzbuch) was enacted, which enables authorities to put on trial anybody who disputes the holocaust hypothesis. This <strong><em>“specific Holocaust law”</em></strong> also offends against the UN’s Universal Declaration Of Human Rights as well as the Declaration of the United Nations Council for Human Rights 2011, which states that, <strong><em>“publication of opinions about historical facts are not to be penalized”</em></strong>, under any circumstances. Thus the German courts still act in <strong><em>“continuation of the war effort of the Allied nations”</em></strong> of World War 2.

Lawyer Horst Mahler was convicted to 10 years and five months in prison for the non-violent assertion of an historical thesis, thereby allegedly violating §130 on three counts.
Horst Mahler is 79 years old and has been imprisoned since 2009. Without a doubt Horst Mahler certainly belongs to Germany’s most educated and most powerful contemporary thinkers and philosophers.
It is owing to his intellect, his wealth of ideas and his courage that he was considered to be a danger to the political establishment and that he needed to be locked away for the rest of his life.
In contrast the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace!

During his time in prison Horst Mahler's health was so badly neglected by the prison authorities that he had to be placed in intensive medical care where it was decided that his left leg was to be amputated. This has done nothing to improve his position however. At this point his health has now reached such a critical state that the authorities are preparing for his imminent death by making plans to suppress any resulting demonstrations by the German people.
It must be noted that Horst Mahler had applied for release on parole after completing two thirds of the sentence, which is regularly granted to any criminal after completion of half of their sentence.
Horst Mahler is financially destitute and cannot afford a lawyer to take his action into court.
However he did succeed in publishing a cry for help from prison:
<br /><br />
<blockquote>
<strong>Dear friends,
For a long time I hesitated asking for help. But now my life is at stake.
My left leg has been amputated and the doctors struggle to avoid further losses.
Eventually one lawyer agreed to run my defence in court.  However, since I am financially ruined, I cannot pay him.
Furthermore, my application for release on parole has to be funded.

In addition, upon my release from prison a certain transformation of my home would be necessary to allow for the life of a disabled.

Please help! Many thanks in advance!
HORST MAHLER</strong>
</blockquote>
