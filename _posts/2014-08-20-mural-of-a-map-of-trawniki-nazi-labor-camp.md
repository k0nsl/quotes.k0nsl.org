<blockquote>Mural of a drawing of the camp during German occupation. Mural of a map of Trawniki "Nazi" labor camp. 

Old <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5CoOX_WxJ0&t=1m00s" target="_blank">sugar factory and tall chimney in the distance</a>. See <a href="http://quotes.k0nsl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Trawniki-old-sugar-plant01_k0nsl.jpg" target="_blank">an old photograph of same building as the one in the video</a>.

The existence of "Nazi Gas Chambers Disguised as Shower Rooms" is a myth!

Question Everything.</blockquote>
