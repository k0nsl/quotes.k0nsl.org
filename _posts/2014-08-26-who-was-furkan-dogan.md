An anonymous person answers the question: "Who was Furkan Dogan?"
<blockquote>He was a 19 year old unarmed American citizen <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who was shot 5 times at close range by Israeli soldiers</span>. One time in the back of the head, one bullet to the face, one in the back and twice in the leg.

I’m sure he was attacking the soldiers in three different directions all at once especially with the third arm that grew out of his back, so don’t worry about it.</blockquote>

So, apparently he's "just another goy" murdered by the Jews..
