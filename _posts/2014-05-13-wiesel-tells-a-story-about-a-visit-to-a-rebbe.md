Wiesel tells a story about a visit to a Rebbe, a Hasidic rabbi, he hadn't seen for 20 years.
The Rebbe is upset to learn that Wiesel has become a writer, and wants to know what he writes.
"Stories," Wiesel tells him, "... true stories":
About people you knew?
"Yes, about people I might have known."
About things that happened?
"Yes, about things that happened or could have happened."
But they did not?
"No, not all of them did. In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end."
The Rebbe leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger:
That means you are writing lies!
I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defence. Yet, I had to justify myself:
"Things are not that simple, Rebbe. <em><strong>Some events do take place but are not true; others are â€“ although they never occurred.</strong></em>"
