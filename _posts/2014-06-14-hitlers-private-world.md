With regard to this video Mr. <a href="http://www.nazigassings.com/" target="_blank">Friedrich P. Berg</a> said the following in 2006:
<blockquote>The greatest man of the twentieth century, Adolf Hitler, appears in the home movies that were made without microphones--but now, with sound added using a newly-developed, lip-reading technology. Hitler was warm and charming, witty and gracious, and even self-effacing just as admirers have always said he was. The revisionists are vindicated once again--and it just goes on, and on.

The Jews are not even mentioned in the home movies. Such a disappointment already for the Jews and other hatemongers, especially quack "historians" such as Richard J. Evans who actually managed to put himself into the same video </blockquote>

Why they bothered to do this "documentary" is beyond me. The most of the clips already had sound and one could hear Hitler speak in his natural voice -- so this is nothing of particular value. For example, see this clip: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRe8PTtNskw" target="_blank">Rarest Document on YouTube?! 1939-Hitler and Friends-Col/Snd</a>, turn up the volume and you will hear his voice. This clip is featured as a great discovery and "re-voiced".
