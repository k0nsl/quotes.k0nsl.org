Leocadio Jiménez Caravaca, was known as "Psycho" during his time on the Eastern Front for his risk taking. In 1977, 2 years after the fall of Franco's regime, he was arrested for an attempt to blow up communist sympathizing lawyers <sup>[1]</sup> in Spain. His answer was unequivocal: <strong><em>"the best part of my life was spent blowing up communists, I never once thought of retiring"</em></strong>.

Señor Caravaca, who had been a brave fighter in División Azul, was actually accused of supplementing weapons and ammunition which was intended to be used to remove communists -- mainly corrupt communist lawyers.
