I collected this from Charles Traynor via RODOH.

I can’t wait to get stuck into this book. Whilst I was leafing through it earlier today I came across something which reminded me of that whinging bore NexGen. For years this moron has been moaning almost continually about the London Blitz and how Jeff Hargeaves’s garden shed sustained a cracked window as a result of German bombing.

Today a different truth is revealed. Even before the big Terror Bombing raids on German cities had begun in earnest the Allies were already engaged in the indiscriminate murder of civilians living in Continental Europe.
<blockquote><strong>Midday Situation Conference</strong>
<strong>December 12, 1942, In the Wolfsschanze</strong>

<em>Beginning 12:45 p.m.</em>

[...]

<em>Situation in the Air</em>

CHRISTIAN: Yesterday the enemy carried out some major daytime attacks against France. With many of his fighter units he first played some kind of running game with our fighter units, then he flew in with 17 aircraft over Rouen to just south of Paris, under relatively low cloud cover. Consequently, he came out again with the majority of his aircraft. Fighters near Paris shot down 2 four-engine aircraft plus 3 Spitfires. Some damage occurred near Rouen―for example, <strong>a French orphanage was hit</strong>―but there was actually only damage to the civilian population.

THE FÜHRER: Those are the honorable Allies; we can’t help them.

JODL: We could bring that out in the French press.
