[05:35] &lt;slashsux&gt; k0nsl|prv
[05:35] &lt;slashsux&gt; you around?
[06:00] &lt;slashsux&gt; god damn it
[06:03] &lt;slashsux&gt; I give you 3 days k0nsl. before I hire assassins to not even kill you. to just fuck with you, and watch you, and break in and get rid of things like.. a hair brush, and put caps lock on when you know you left it off. and every morning, the refrigerator will be slightly ajar, and you will wonder if they took a drink of something
[06:04] &lt;slashsux&gt; you'll eventually start marking things, the level of drinks, and then every morning, the drinks will be below the sharpie line, and you freak the fuck out.
[06:04] &lt;slashsux&gt; and its perfect, because you'll never change your fucking locks. because youre stupid.
[06:04] &lt;slashsux&gt; OR
[06:04] &lt;slashsux&gt; OR
[06:04] &lt;slashsux&gt; OR
[06:04] &lt;slashsux&gt; which, I prefer to happen...
[06:04] &lt;slashsux&gt; you just be a good system admin, and fix the god damn services.
