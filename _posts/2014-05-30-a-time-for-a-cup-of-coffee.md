[14:34] &lt;k0nsl|prv&gt; veiled threat..? sounds like it.
[14:43] &lt;@Digerati&gt; nah, sounds like the precursor to a pleasant chat to me
[14:43] &lt;@Digerati&gt; k0nsl|prv: despite our history, I'd be happy to have a friendly coffee or beer with you :p
[14:43] &lt;@Digerati&gt; actually, maybe because of our history...?
