<blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">There were three ravens sat on a tree They were as black as they might be</p>
The one of them said to his mate "Where shall we our breakfast take?"

<b>Down in yonder Iraqi soil A feast of blood, a sea of oil.</b>

"Will not they rise with sword &amp; gun To send us back to kingdom come?"

From sky we'll strike with shock &amp; awe And then marines will kill some more.

Add phosphorous, jails, uranium Pain &amp; pandemonium.

"When all is done", asked raven of mate, "Where shall we our breakfast take?"

<b>Down in yonder Iranian soil A feast of blood, a sea of oil.</b></blockquote>
