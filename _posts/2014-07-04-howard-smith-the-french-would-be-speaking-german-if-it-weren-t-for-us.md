An American genius made the following entry in a YouTube video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TicVwvt-3Ow" target="_blank">'SHOAHNANAS -OPUS II- Dieudonné Le clip'</a>:
<blockquote>If the Americans didn't show up in Paris to save those dumb ass French from the Nazi's they would be speaking German right now and drinking beer and not wine. Let them have their equally dumb ass comic! Enough Americans died for them because they couldn't defend their own country!</blockquote>
That comment  is sadly typically American — exceptional in worthlessness, excelling in stupidity and thoroughly full of historical ignorance. I always get somewhat of a chuckle out of comments such as that because they're so devoid of reality, and as I say, so typically American. Incredible, really. And sad.

PS:
The absolute majority of the adult French population already spoke German!
