This is the first result returned by the Google search engine when we query it with the following:

<a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=was%20hitler%20a%20liar" target="_blank">"was Hitler a liar"</a>

This query returns my response titled <a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/responses/adolf-hitler-notorious-lia/" target="_blank">"Adolf Hitler was a notorious liar"</a>. This prominent presence on Google does a lot for my daily page views, though it may return different results for some people. I've tried it on anonymizing services and it still returns my response.
