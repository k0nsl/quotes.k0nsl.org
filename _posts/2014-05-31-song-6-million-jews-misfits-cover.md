They call me a 'nazi' just because
I don't believe in the "holocaust"
The things that happened to the jews in the second world war
Bullshit and lies I won't take it anymore

I seen it all
I heard it all
The lampshades and soaps
Its all fairytales and jokes
I got one thing to say to you

<strong>6 000 000 jews didn't die</strong>
<strong>6 000 000 jews didn't die</strong>
<strong>6 000 000 jews didn't die</strong>

They showed me the pictures from the camps
It wasn't heaven, but don't you understand
That the zionists said they went through a living hell
So they could steal a land and rename it israel

Palestine
We're on your side
The holocaust hoax
is about to be exposed
Now listen what the people are screaming:
<strong>6 000 000 jews didn't die</strong>
<strong>6 000 000 jews didn't die</strong>
<strong>6 000 000 jews didn't die</strong>
