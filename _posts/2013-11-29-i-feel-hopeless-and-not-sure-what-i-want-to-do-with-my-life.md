<blockquote>Has anyone from the HN community served in the military? if so what are the pros and cons of joining? I'm only 21 and at this stage of my life I feel hopeless and not sure what I want to do with my life. I enjoy programming but sometimes I get distracted and bored easily siting and programming all day I guess I need some kind of adventure or challenge I feel like I want to help others in a way that changes their life.

Don't join the army, particularly if you're an American. They've caused enough issues in the world. The world would be a much better place if nobody joined the American army.

Typically a discussion on this subject may look somewhat like this:
<blockquote><strong>Somebody:</strong> If nobody joined the American army the world would be a much better place.

<strong>Pro-American-War-Monger:</strong> BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR FREEEEDOMS?

<strong>Somebody:</strong> Yeah, but what about <em>ours</em>?</blockquote>
