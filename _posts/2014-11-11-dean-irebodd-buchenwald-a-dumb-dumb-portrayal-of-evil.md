<blockquote>The liberation of the German war-time concentration camp at Buchenwald presented an opportunity for an Allied Psyche Warfare operation meant to denazify the Germans via atrocity stories. The person in charge reported directly to Eisenhower, so it was coordinated from higher up. But this operation "blew back" into USA media, which is why Americans remember growing up hearing stories of lampshades made of the skin of murdered inmates. President Barack Obama visiting in June 2009 showed that everyone is still misled.

the first edition of "Buchenwald" was released in August 2008. It has been pointed out correctly that the part in the video about DDT and the Germans knowing about DDT is somewhat inaccurate. Besides that, as of March 2012, no one, including any history professor, has attempted to refute any aspect of the video.

A 2 hour and 22 minute movie.</blockquote>
