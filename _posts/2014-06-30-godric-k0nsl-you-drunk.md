&lt;godric&gt; k0nsl you drunk?
&lt;RaGe[]&gt; prolly
* RaGe[] eats the bowl
&lt;godric&gt; lol!
&lt;godric&gt; RaGe[] is consuming all my good stuff
* godric fixes himself another drink
&lt;RaGe[]&gt; heh ;P
&lt;godric&gt; RaGe[] I must warn you about Digerati. He sometimes likes to get things on cam.
&lt;RaGe[]&gt; good thing we're unmonitored
&lt;godric&gt; :o

This is funny because k0nsl doesn't drink -- since more than two years back. Well, nothing Â containing alcohol, anyway.
