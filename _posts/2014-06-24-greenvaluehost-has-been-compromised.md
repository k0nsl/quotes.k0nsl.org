<blockquote>Both GVH's WHMCS and SolusVM have been compromised. We cannot say whether any data has been breached at this time, but given that the server has been compromised, I strongly recommend you assume that there is a high risk of data breach and you should reset passwords on other sites where you have reused the same passwordl
&nbsp;
We are working at the moment to restore both of them, we will update again in 1 hour.</blockquote>
